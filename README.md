"Lifeline" is an innovative project dedicated to enhancing worker safety in industrial environments. By integrating sensor-equipped devices with cloudbased infrastructure, Lifeline offers real-time monitoring and alerting systems for toxic conditions. Its user-friendly app provides workers with instant updates and alerts about toxicity levels, empowering them to take immediate action to protect themselves and others.The project leverages machine learning to analyze data patterns and predict potential hazards, further enhancing its capability to protect workers by providing advanced warning of possible dangers.
Anchored in the principles of sustainability, Lifeline embodies a proactive approach towards workplace safety, contributing to safer and healthier industrial environments.

##How we built it
We built Lifeline using a combination of gas sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication modules. The data is processed and sent to a cloud-based platform, which powers the real-time monitoring and alert system. A mobile app was developed to allow users to access data, receive alerts, and track historical information remotely. The design prioritizes durability and ease of use for industrial workers in harsh conditions.
